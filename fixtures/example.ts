/*
This is an example file to show how to work with Pepr capabilities. Before authoring 
Pepr capabilities, make sure to run the command `pepr setup` to configure this environment.
For the best experience, we recommend using VSCode or another IDE with TypeScript support.

NOTE: This file will be overwritten by the `pepr setup` command and should only be used for 
reference for ways to use the Pepr SDK. If you want to generate a new capability, run the
`pepr new` command.
